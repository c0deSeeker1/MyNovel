# Chapter 21 – Mending

Jace decided to change tactics, but the new approach felt even more suffocating than before.

Instead of showering Avery with extravagant gifts, he began to play the role of the devoted suitor. Every single day, without fail, he appeared either at the entrance of her office or outside her apartment, carrying a lunch he insisted he had personally prepared.

He no longer raised his voice in anger. Instead, he simply stood silently, gazing at her with an expression that suggested she was the one who had done him wrong.

One evening, after Avery had completely ignored him, Jace’s frustration boiled over. In a sudden outburst, he slammed his fist against a concrete wall. Blood immediately seeped from his knuckles, dripping down his hand. With his palm still wet with his own blood, he approached the window of Avery’s car and rasped hoarsely, “Avery, would you even look at me if I’m like this? Just once…”

Sitting inside the car, Avery felt a wave of nausea rise in her stomach as she watched Jace’s desperate display. Without hesitation, she locked the doors and quickly dialed the police.

To Avery, this so-called devotion was far worse than his earlier arrogance. It felt like a form of emotional manipulation, a psychological torment that weighed heavily on her.

Meanwhile, their parents had finally reached their limit. Julian and Jace’s rivalry had spiraled out of control, fueled by their obsession over a woman they both now saw as disgraced. Julian’s personal turmoil was bleeding into his professional life, while Jace had fully sunk into a reckless lifestyle.

Their father, Richard Mercer, summoned both sons home in frustration.

“You two are completely out of your minds!” Richard barked, his voice sharp with anger. “You’ve turned against each other over a woman who’s brought nothing but trouble, and you’re neglecting the family business! Stop this nonsense immediately, or I’ll cut off your financial support!”

In the past, that threat might have been enough to bring them back to their senses. But now, their obsession had clouded any semblance of reason.

Julian’s jaw tightened, his expression hardening. “This isn’t your concern,” he said coldly.

Jace pushed back even further. “Go ahead and cut me off. I don’t need your money to win her back.”

Their father’s warnings only seemed to fuel their stubborn defiance. Instead of calming down, their obsession grew more intense, turning every failure into a sharper edge of possessiveness and rage.

Through it all, Avery remained steadfast. She met their relentless pressure and constant harassment with unwavering indifference. She refused to give them any opening.

She stuck to her daily routine—working long hours at the office, hitting the gym afterward, and spending weekends hiking or visiting art exhibits with new friends she had carefully chosen.

Every number or social media account connected to the Mercers was blocked. She never responded to their attempts to contact her, and if things escalated, she didn’t hesitate to call the police.

Though the constant harassment took a toll on her life, Avery managed to keep the damage to a minimum. She committed herself to therapy, focusing on healing and personal growth. She poured every ounce of her energy into rebuilding herself, scrubbing Julian and Jace out of her world like stubborn stains that refused to fade.

Her cold indifference, combined with their repeated failures, pushed the Mercer brothers to the brink of collapse.

One night, fate brought them face to face in the garage of a private club.

Jace’s passenger seat held a massive bouquet of flowers, the sight of which instantly ignited Julian’s temper like a spark to dry tinder.

“Jace! I told you to stay away from her!” Julian snapped, his voice low and dangerous.

Jace sneered. “Why? Because you’re the one who hurt her the most? What right do you have to say that?”

“Because I love her! I want to marry her!” Julian blurted out, the words escaping before he could think twice.

“Love her? Marry her?” Jace laughed bitterly, as if hearing the cruelest joke in the world. “Your so-called love already destroyed her. Marriage to you would be another kind of hell. Don’t disgust her, Julian. She’ll never choose you.”

The fury that had been building inside Julian exploded in an instant. Without hesitation, he punched Jace square in the face.

Jace, caught off guard, felt his lip split and blood trickle down. For a moment, he froze, then surged forward in rage. “How dare you hit me!”

In the dimly lit garage, the two brothers tore into each other like wild beasts. Fists and kicks flew with reckless abandon, fueled solely by anger and bitter jealousy.

They cursed each other fiercely, their blows brutal and unrelenting, fighting not as brothers, but as bitter enemies.

When the fight finally exhausted them, they collapsed onto the cold concrete floor, gasping for breath. Their shirts were shredded, faces swollen with bruises, and their eyes burned only with hatred.

Jace wiped the blood from his mouth, hauled himself upright, and glared down at Julian. “From now on, you’re not my brother,” he said slowly, emphasizing each word. “Avery is mine. We’ll see who’s better.”

He staggered to his car and sped away, tires screeching on the pavement.

Julian lay on the ground, chest heaving, eyes fixed on the ceiling above. What filled those eyes wasn’t pain—it was a cold, gnawing madness.

In that moment, whatever brotherhood had once existed between them shattered completely, ending right there in the shadows of the garage.
