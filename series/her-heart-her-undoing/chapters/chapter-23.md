# Chapter 23 – Dawn

Julian and Jace remained on their knees, pressed against the cold, slippery floor of the dimly lit hallway. Their eyes were fixed on the door before them—an unyielding barrier that would never open for them again. It was as though the very essence of their beings had been wrenched away, leaving them hollow and broken.

That night marked a turning point. They collapsed under the weight of their grief, as if their spines had been cruelly torn from their bodies. The pain was so profound it rendered them nearly immobile, trapped in a silent agony.

Julian retreated into the world of Mercer Group, but the man who returned was a shadow of his former self. He grew quieter, more withdrawn—his warmth replaced by a chilling coldness that bordered on cruelty. His demeanor was sharp and unyielding, a stark contrast to the man he had once been.

He threw himself into his work with a manic intensity, sleeping in the office and filling every waking hour with meetings, negotiations, and endless deals. There was no time left for feelings, no space for vulnerability. He became a machine—relentless, ruthless, and utterly focused. His decisions were swift and merciless, driving the company’s rapid expansion and a steady flow of wealth.

Yet, despite his success, Julian stood completely alone. He rejected every arranged marriage proposal without hesitation and dismissed any woman who dared to approach him. His life shrank into a cold cycle of numbers, contracts, and unending corporate battles. The man who once had a heart now lived in a barren wasteland of solitude. He vowed never to marry, convinced that love was a luxury he could no longer afford.

Jace, on the other hand, chose a path that seemed to lead in the opposite direction.

He sought to drown his sorrow in alcohol, wild parties, and an endless parade of fleeting encounters. His nights were a blur of reckless indulgence, fueled by expensive drinks and careless thrills. He burned through money as if it could erase the emptiness inside him, becoming a fixture in scandalous headlines and tabloid gossip.

But no matter how loud the music or how crowded the room, Jace’s eyes remained vacant—his smiles hollow and unconvincing. After the revelry died down, he would often find himself alone by a window until the first light of dawn, watching the city’s gray skyline with nothing left inside but a profound loneliness.

No one ever managed to touch his heart again, and peaceful sleep became a distant memory.

Years passed, and a major business summit gathered the industry’s most powerful figures. Glasses clinked in celebration, voices buzzed with ambition, and the room pulsed with energy.

Julian stood out among the crowd like a titan of industry. He moved through the gathering with precise control, his expression unreadable. No one dared to peer behind the cold mask that concealed the turmoil within.

Across the room, Jace was the picture of a carefree playboy, arm draped around a famous actress as he laughed and flirted with practiced ease. Yet, even his charm couldn’t mask the shadow behind his eyes.

Then, their gazes met—just for a fleeting moment—before quickly drifting apart. The distance between them was palpable, as if they were strangers passing in a crowded street.

The bitterness and resentment that had once consumed them had long since burned away, reduced to nothing but ashes by time and shared despair.

Midway through the summit, Daniel leaned in to quietly update Julian. At nearly the same moment, one of Jace’s drinking companions called him with the identical news.

Avery had risen to become one of the most respected experts in her field. She led significant projects, earning a sterling reputation for her work. More importantly, she was married—to a man from a distinguished family. Their love story wasn’t the stuff of dramatic novels, but rather a quiet, steady bond built on mutual respect and warmth. Her life was peaceful, and she was genuinely happy.

For a moment, time seemed to stand still. The noise of the summit faded into the background.

Julian’s fingers clenched tightly around his glass, causing the amber whiskey inside to ripple and tremble. A crack appeared in his carefully maintained facade, and a flicker of raw emotion flashed in his eyes before fading back into the familiar hollow stillness.

He saw her in white, smiling at another man—a happiness he had never earned and could never claim.

Meanwhile, Jace’s smile froze abruptly. His phone slipped from his grasp, shattering on the floor. The laughter around him turned sharp and grating. The world blurred, and all he could feel was the aching void deep in his chest, accompanied by a dull ringing that seemed to echo endlessly.

He pictured Avery, cherished and loved by someone else. All the warmth he had once desperately sought—so desperately that he had hurt her in the process—now belonged to another.

Without exchanging a word, both men turned their gaze in the same direction, as if they could see through walls and miles to the life Avery was living—the life they could never share.

They stood at the pinnacle of wealth and power, yet it felt as though they possessed nothing at all.

Inside, only ruins remained—an endless wasteland of regret that gnawed at their souls with relentless persistence.

In that harshest of moments, they finally grasped the true meaning of losing a love that would never come back to them.
