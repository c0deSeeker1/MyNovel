# Chapter 22 – Return

Julian and Jace had exhausted every possible tactic they could dream up to win Avery back. They had tried to leverage their influence, flaunted their wealth, pleaded desperately, followed her every move, and even faked injuries to elicit sympathy. Yet, every single effort crumbled against the impenetrable barrier Avery had erected—a fortress built from icy silence and deliberate distance. All their attempts left behind nothing but ruins and a deeper, gnawing despair.

Eventually, their energy drained completely, forcing them to confront a harsh truth neither wanted to face: they had lost her forever.

It wasn’t that Avery lacked a heart. Rather, they had shattered whatever fragile emotions she might have once nurtured, along with her self-respect and the life she deserved to live.

One evening, under a steady drizzle, Julian parked his car on the corner opposite Avery’s apartment building. He didn’t step out. Instead, he stayed inside, staring through the rain-streaked windshield at the window glowing softly with warm light.

His fingers trembled as he dialed a number he knew was blocked long ago—the one he had tried calling countless times before. As he expected, the line gave him only a cold, unyielding busy tone.

Steeling himself, he finally climbed out of the car. The rain soaked through his expensive suit, plastering his hair against his forehead and leaving him looking more disheveled than ever. He lifted his face toward the sky, letting the cold droplets wash over him, as if the rain might somehow cleanse the ache tearing through his chest.

Suddenly, the screech of tires cut through the quiet evening. A sleek sports car skidded to a halt beside him. Jace jumped out, equally drenched, his eyes blazing with the same frantic mixture of panic and desperate hope.

Their eyes met through the rain, and in that brief glance, they recognized the same despair mirrored back at them—the same stubborn refusal to let go.

Neither shouted nor argued. They resembled two wounded animals, stripped of claws and strength, barely able to make a sound.

One after the other, they entered the apartment building, their footsteps muffled by the rain. They rode the elevator in silence, the tension thick between them.

When they reached Avery’s door, Julian’s hand trembled as he pressed the bell.

Avery opened the door, dressed casually in soft loungewear, a book still clutched loosely in her hand. The warm light spilling from inside framed her face, which was cold and detached.

She looked at the two soaked, disheveled men standing before her without a flicker of emotion. No surprise, no anger—just the same blank expression she might give to a delivery person who’d come to the wrong address.

“Avery…” Julian’s voice cracked, rain dripping from his chin. “I… I know it’s too late for anything I say, but please… I’m begging you… just give me one more chance. One last chance…” His voice faltered, the words catching in his throat. “Without you, I—”

Before he could finish, Jace shoved Julian aside and dropped to his knees. The sharp crack of bone hitting tile echoed through the quiet hallway. Rain and tears streaked down Jace’s face as he looked up at her, voice raw and broken.

“Ave!” he pleaded, “I was wrong! I know I was! Hit me! Scold me! Do whatever you want—just don’t throw me away. Please… I can’t live without you… I love you!”

The man who once thrived on conquest was now reduced to a desperate supplicant, begging for a single glance from her.

Julian stared at Jace, something inside him snapping painfully. He closed his eyes, swallowed his pride, and then dropped to his knees beside him. All his dignity meant nothing compared to the terror of losing Avery forever.

Once, they had stood over her, believing they controlled her fate. Now, they knelt like beggars, pleading for a chance they themselves had destroyed.

But Avery saw nothing but their desperation, their broken pleas, their hollow devotion—and felt nothing in return.

After a long, heavy silence, she finally spoke. Her voice was cold as the rain outside, stripped of anger or hatred, carrying only the weary indifference of someone who had already moved on.

“When I look at you,” she said slowly, each word cutting through the silence like a blade, “all I see is the disgust and the pain you left me with.”

Both Julian and Jace jerked their heads up, the color draining from their faces.

“Please,” she added, her gaze steady and unyielding, “just disappear from my life for good.”

Without another word, she stepped back and closed the door firmly.

The soft thud echoed faintly down the hallway, but to Julian and Jace, it shattered their world. It severed the last fragile thread of hope they clung to, leaving behind only emptiness and silence.
