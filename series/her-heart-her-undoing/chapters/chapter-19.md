# Chapter 19 – Breaking Point

When Avery suddenly raised the pepper spray toward him, Julian froze in place, caught completely off guard. A flicker of disbelief crossed his eyes, quickly followed by a deep, aching hurt that was hard to hide.

Meanwhile, Jace’s behavior spiraled into even more extreme and unpredictable territory.

There were moments when he completely broke down, tears streaming down his face as he begged her for forgiveness. He would slap his own cheeks in frustration, pleading that he truly regretted everything and that his love for her was real and unwavering.

But just as often, his anger erupted violently. He lashed out at her coldness, smashing whatever objects lay within his reach. On one occasion, he yanked her abruptly away from her classmates mid-conversation, leaving everyone so shocked that they called the police in fear.

Using his family’s powerful connections, Jace pressured the university and even Avery’s landlord, squeezing her academically and financially until she felt trapped and forced to relent.

The brothers had become locked in a bitter rivalry, viewing each other as nothing more than enemies.

Julian responded by stationing his men around Jace, intercepting him whenever he tried to get close to Avery.

In retaliation, Jace sabotaged every attempt Julian made to win her heart—crushing bouquets of flowers, tossing aside gifts, and blasting loud music to drown out any words Julian tried to whisper to her.

This relentless, suffocating pursuit didn’t make Avery feel cherished or loved. Instead, it filled her with revulsion and fear.

What they called love was nothing more than possession masked as devotion, selfishness cloaked in false tenderness.

Her disgust grew so intense that just the sight of either brother made her stomach churn.

Determined to escape this toxic cycle, Avery threw herself into her studies with renewed focus. She earned straight A’s, applied for scholarships, and began building her own savings. She immersed herself in group projects, made new friends, and started to carve out a fresh chapter in her life.

Though her heart still ached, she pushed herself to give other men a chance, desperately trying to move forward.

Her firm refusals and cold indifference cut deeply into Julian and Jace, wounding them more than they could express.

After every failed attempt and every violent outburst, Jace began to change. The arrogance that once defined him gave way to a dark obsession, heavy with pain and regret.

He truly did feel remorse, and the guilt gnawed at him relentlessly, but every step he took only drove Avery further away.

Julian suffered as well. He struggled to learn how to love Avery with his whole heart. Slowly, he began to understand her favorites, to notice what she needed instead of taking her for granted.

He swallowed his pride bit by bit, learning to be patient, to read the subtle shifts in her expressions, and to maintain his composure under her icy gaze.

Yet the damage he had inflicted ran too deep, and he realized he had recognized his feelings far too late. To Avery, his sudden tenderness appeared nothing more than a hollow act.

No matter how much he tried to change, it meant almost nothing. With Jace constantly lurking nearby, even Julian’s best efforts seemed clumsy and irritating.

They haunted her in this unfamiliar city, but there were no winners—only pain, exhaustion, and relentless tension.

Jealousy flared with every hint that the other might be gaining ground with Avery. Yet her indifference left them powerless, and the terror of losing her forever pushed them into an even darker frenzy.

Three years in Lambain gave Avery the opportunity to build a new life from the ground up. She worked tirelessly, letting sweat and late nights wash away the shadows of her past.

By the time she graduated with honors from a prestigious program, she had secured a coveted offer from Sterling Holdings, one of the country’s leading firms.

She was no longer the woman who needed a man to lean on, nor was she the one who begged for fragments of love.

She chopped her long hair short, shedding the fear and uncertainty that once clouded her eyes. In their place was a calm, unwavering strength. The old wounds never fully healed, but she learned how to live with them, building walls strong enough to keep her standing.

Her decision to return to her country was driven by her career ambitions, not nostalgia.

She braced herself for whatever awaited—gossip, rumors, or the Mercer brothers who still refused to understand the meaning of “no.” All she wanted was a clean break and a life that belonged solely to her.

On the day her flight was booked, the lookouts stationed near her apartment and around campus sent urgent word within the hour.

Julian was in the middle of a crucial cross-border merger meeting when Daniel burst in, leaning down to whisper a few hurried words in his ear.

The calm expression Julian wore shattered instantly, replaced by a sharp urgency teetering on panic. He shot to his feet, his chair scraping loudly against the floor.

“We’ll pause here!” he announced to the room full of executives watching on the screen, then rushed out before anyone could respond.

“Get the car ready! Head to the airport!” he barked into his phone, his voice trembling as he took the elevator down to the lobby.

He had waited three long years for this moment. Missing it was not an option.

Across the city, Jace lounged in a dimly lit private club, a glass of whiskey in hand when his phone suddenly lit up.

The moment he ended the call, he shoved a woman off his lap, springing to his feet with desperate, blazing eyes.

“She’s back? She’s finally back!” he exclaimed, voice sharp with urgency. “Hurry! We’re going to the airport! I’m not letting Julian get there first!”
