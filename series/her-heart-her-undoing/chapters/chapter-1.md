# Chapter 1 – The First Crack

Avery Whitlock was the epitome of perfection at Northbridge University—the kind of woman every guy dreamed about. She was smart, beautiful, and effortlessly graceful. Yet, everything changed in an instant when private photos of her suddenly surfaced on the campus forum. Overnight, her flawless reputation was torn to shreds. The university wasted no time rescinding her direct admission to the master’s program, leaving her future hanging by a thread. Walking through the campus streets became unbearable as strangers sneered and shouted cruel remarks like, “How much for a night?” The humiliation was suffocating.

There was only one person who could have leaked those photos—her boyfriend, Julian Mercer. Fueled by a mix of confusion and betrayal, Avery rushed to Julian’s apartment, desperate for answers. Her hand trembled as it gripped the doorknob, but before she could knock, voices drifted through the thin door.

“Julian, that was ruthless,” Ryan Kincaid’s sharp laugh pierced the silence. “You posted those photos, and now Avery’s done for. Her direct admission? Gone. Let’s see if she ever dares to challenge Tessa again.”

Logan Hart’s voice cut in, mocking, “Come on! Julian hasn’t liked Avery for two years. He couldn’t even stand to touch her. He sent his brother to do the dirty work. Imagine her face if she ever found out!”

The words exploded in Avery’s mind like a bomb. She clapped a trembling hand over her mouth to stifle the scream rising in her throat. Her skin grew pale as shock and disbelief washed over her.

Logan jabbed the man sitting beside Julian, a man who bore an uncanny resemblance to him. “Hey, Jace, you’ve been sleeping with your brother’s girlfriend for two years. How does that feel? We’re dying to know.”

Jace lifted his glass, flashing a crooked smile. “What can I say? She’s a knockout. Smooth skin, the sweetest moan, and she lets me do whatever I want. That’s why I’m transferring to Northbridge—so I can make out with her whenever I want.”

Finally, Julian’s voice cut through the room, cold and merciless, each word laced with icy precision. “You’ve got a few days. Do whatever you want now. Once Tessa’s admission is secured, I’ll cut Avery off and ask Tessa to be my girlfriend.”

Ryan whooped in disbelief. “Seriously? You’re finally making a move on Tessa? You’ve been into her for years—spoiling her since you were kids. There’s only one direct admission spot, and Tessa wanted it badly. The moment you realized Avery was your biggest competition, you started dating her and cooked up this whole scheme. Man, who could treat Tessa better than you?”

Each sentence felt like a brutal strike to Avery’s chest. She stood frozen, her body numb and her blood running cold. So this was the truth—vile, cruel, and utterly heartbreaking. She couldn’t bear to stay another second. Turning on her heel, she fled down the stairs, stumbling into a narrow alley, tears blurring her vision and choking her breath.

Her parents were strict, uncompromising, and she had never dated before Julian. She had always believed love was a distraction, a waste of time. But everything changed freshman year. She was crossing the outdoor courts, arms full of books, when suddenly a basketball flew toward her face. She flinched, bracing for the hit, but it never came. Instead, a tall, composed young man caught the ball effortlessly.

Looking up, she met a pair of dark, indifferent eyes. The golden sunset cast a warm glow over his broad shoulders, and sweat gleamed on his temple. He looked sculpted, as if carved from stone rather than born. Her heart skipped an unexpected beat, a feeling she couldn’t quite explain.

Later, she learned his name—Julian Mercer, the campus heartthrob everyone admired. Born into wealth, his family’s name adorned several university buildings funded by them. Julian was absurdly handsome and coolly detached about it. Women lined up for his attention, but he ignored them all except for Tessa Simpson, the rising star of the music department.

From the start, Avery knew she and Julian belonged to different worlds. So, she buried her feelings deep and threw herself into her studies, consistently ranking first in her class. Yet fate seemed to conspire against her as she kept running into Julian—whether in the library, lecture halls, or cafeteria, he was always nearby.

One day, exhausted from studying, she dozed off at a table. When she woke, her head was resting on Julian’s shoulder. She snapped upright, cheeks flaming, but he gently caught her wrist.

“Avery, do you want to be my girlfriend?” he asked quietly.

Her mind went blank, but a rush of joy flooded her chest, and she nodded, almost dazed.

From that moment, dating Julian felt strange. By day, he was distant—barely texting, showing up to dates as if fulfilling an obligation. But at night, he transformed into someone else: hungry, relentless, and always ready to snap pictures with his phone in bed. The photos unsettled her, but she pushed the unease aside. He was always so cool and aloof during the day because he was busy, she told herself. But at night, he showed his true feelings—he loved her.

What she never imagined was that Julian and Jace were two different people entirely. Julian spent his days with her, while Jace shared her nights. To them, Avery was nothing more than a plaything—an object to be used for their pleasure. Their real goal was to destroy everything she had worked for and hand it over to Tessa.

Now, sitting alone in the empty alley, Avery felt her body give way. She sank to the cold ground, tears spilling freely, each sob wracking her to the core.

Her phone suddenly rang. It was her mother. Hands shaking, Avery answered.

Margaret Jones wasted no time, launching into a furious tirade. “Avery! What are those filthy photos doing on the campus forum? The Student Affairs office already called me. Do you know how much shame you’ve brought upon this family?”

Her father’s voice growled in the background. “We worked ourselves to the bone for you, and this is how you repay us? You’ve disgraced us in front of the entire university! Shame on you!”

Avery couldn’t form a response. Her chest tightened painfully, suffocating her breath. Her parents had always been strict, their approval reserved only for her academic triumphs. They smiled only when she took first place or won awards. She had sacrificed everything for their love, yet now, at her lowest, they offered nothing but scorn.

“You’re always crying! Is that all you know? Your direct admission is gone! We’ve already bought you a ticket to Ardenia at the end of the month. You’ll stay abroad for a few years until this scandal blows over. Only then will you be allowed to come back,” Margaret said coldly, leaving no room for argument.

A deep chill settled in Avery’s heart.

“Okay,” she whispered numbly.

She would go to Ardenia—but she was certain of one thing: she would never return.
