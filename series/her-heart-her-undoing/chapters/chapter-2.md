# Chapter 2 – Fault Lines

Avery ended the call and sank back into the quiet of the apartment she shared with Julian, feeling hollow and drained, as if all the life had been sucked out of her. Without really thinking, she began to gather her things, her movements mechanical and numb. One by one, she threw away every gift Julian had ever given her over the past year—necklaces, bracelets, stuffed animals, even the lipstick she had worn countless times. What once symbolized their love now felt like a bitter mockery. Her hand trembled as she dropped the last necklace into the trash bin just as the apartment door clicked open.

Julian was not the one who entered. It was Jace. He stepped inside, adopting Julian’s usual cool, detached tone but softening it with a practiced warmth that didn’t quite reach his eyes. “Ave, what are you tossing out?” he asked, his voice calm but probing.

Avery lifted her gaze, her eyes swollen and red from crying, and met the face so like Julian’s—only younger, with a sharper arrogance that made her chest ache as though it had been torn open from the inside. The pain was so intense she struggled to draw breath. “Don’t you recognize any of this?” she whispered, her voice brittle and cold.

For a moment, Jace’s confident smile faltered, but he quickly recovered, shifting his tone to its usual smoothness. “Your eyes are puffy. Is it because of those photos on the forum? Don’t worry—I’ve taken care of it. The posts are gone, and no one’s going to say a word.”

He stepped closer, his words cutting deeper than any knife. “So what if the direct admission’s off the table? You’re just a junior. You can try again next year, or skip grad school altogether and come work for me. I’ll look after you.”

His offer felt like a cruel twist, slicing through her heart. She clenched her fists tightly, nails digging into her palms. Jace and Julian could easily win an award for their act—their seamless performance of charm and control. Avery opened her mouth to respond, but before she could say a word, Jace was pulling her into his arms, pressing his chin gently against her hair.

“Hey, don’t cry. It kills me when you do, okay?” His familiar scent enveloped her, wrapping around her like a suffocating shroud. His lips brushed the tender skin of her neck, and his hands roamed over her body. On any other night, she might have blushed, melted into his touch, and let herself be led. But tonight, a cold numbness spread through her, twisting her stomach into knots. She pushed him away with sudden force.

Caught off guard, Jace’s eyes flashed with surprise before he masked it with his usual smooth demeanor. “What’s wrong? Not feeling it?”

“I don’t feel well,” Avery said softly, turning her face away from him.

He studied her silently for a few moments, then let out a short, humorless laugh. “Alright. I’ll take a cold shower.”

Without pressing her further, he turned and disappeared into the bathroom. Avery resumed packing, methodically erasing every trace of their shared life she could find. When she finally finished, she collapsed onto the bed, turning her back to the bathroom door.

Minutes later, Jace emerged, still damp, and slid quietly beside her. He lay still for a while, but soon his restraint gave way. Curling up behind her, he pressed a gentle kiss to the soft spot beneath her ear and traced the line of her shoulder with his lips. She stiffened but endured the touch, drifting on the edge of sleep, until she heard him murmur in a low, muffled voice as he shifted against her.

“Tessa…”

The single name struck her like a sudden blow, sharp and cold as an ice pick. Avery jolted awake, a freezing ache spreading through her chest. So, it wasn’t only Julian who loved Tessa—Jace thought of her every time he touched Avery.

She shoved him away once more, teeth clenched as the words spilled out. “I told you. I don’t feel well.”

Her fierce rejection visibly unsettled him. For the first time, he seemed to sense something was deeply wrong. He exhaled a long, resigned sigh. “Okay, okay. I won’t force you. I’ll just hold you, alright?”

True to his word, he wrapped an arm around her from behind, holding her gently. Avery lay stiff within his embrace, silent tears soaking into her pillow. Waves of pain and disgust surged through her until, near dawn, exhaustion finally pulled her under.

When she woke, the other side of the bed was cold and empty. She used to wonder why Julian never walked with her to campus. Now, the truth was clear. He wasn’t the one lying beside her at night. He had never truly wanted to be close.

Numb, Avery rose, washed her face, and prepared to go to the university to complete her withdrawal. But barely had she crossed the quad when a student came running up, blocking her path.

“Avery! Thank God! Dr. Hale wants to see you right now! He says it’s urgent!”

A sinking feeling settled deep in her chest. Something bad was coming.

She reached the office door and knocked lightly.

“Come in,” Martin Hale’s voice called.

Avery stepped inside to find Tessa already seated, her eyes flashing with a smug malice that quickly shifted to a fragile, wounded expression. Martin’s face was clouded with anger as he slammed two printed theses onto his desk.

“Avery! Tessa! Explain this! Your papers are nearly identical, down to the typos! Academic misconduct is a serious offense. Integrity comes first! If one of you copied, speak up now! The university will be more lenient if you’re honest.”

Before Avery could respond, Tessa cut in sharply, “Dr. Hale, I wrote my paper myself! I don’t know why it looks like Avery’s, but I didn’t plagiarize!”

Avery’s heart sank as she stared down at the pages, but she kept her voice calm and steady. “Dr. Hale, I wrote mine on my own. I didn’t copy anyone.”

Martin pressed his hand to his temple in frustration. “You both insist you didn’t copy. Then where’s the proof?”

“I have a witness,” Tessa said quickly.

Just then, the door opened again, and Julian stepped inside.
