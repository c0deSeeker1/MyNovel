# Chapter 20 – After the Fall

The international arrivals hall buzzed with a restless crowd, a sea of faces moving in every direction.

Avery navigated through the throng, her suitcase rolling steadily behind her. She wore a cream trench coat that hugged her frame, her posture upright and composed. Her face was a mask—calm, unreadable, revealing nothing of the storm beneath.

Over the past three years, life had stripped away the softness she once carried. What remained was a sharper, more poised version of herself—more striking than ever, and undeniably distant, unreachable.

No sooner had she crossed the threshold of her hometown airport than two groups surged forward from opposite sides, closing in like predators sensing vulnerability. They boxed her in tightly within the narrow exit corridor.

On the left, Julian led his group with an air of controlled intensity. His suit was impeccably tailored, fitting him as if made just for him. He was still undeniably handsome, but the tension between his brows betrayed a restless urgency. Clutched in his arms were pristine white calla lilies—symbols of devotion tangled with regret. His gaze locked onto Avery’s, heavy with longing and a possessiveness that refused to loosen its grip.

“Avery, welcome home,” he said, striving to keep his voice steady, though it emerged hoarse and strained.

On the right, Jace appeared, his bright coat a stark contrast to the dark circles shadowing his eyes. His hair was meticulously styled, but the wild edge in his expression couldn’t be masked. In his hands, an open velvet box displayed a dazzling diamond necklace that sparkled under the harsh airport lights. He pushed past Julian’s people, stepping forward with feverish intensity.

“Ave! You finally came back! I knew you still had feelings for me! This necklace is for you! Do you like it?”

Their confrontation instantly captured the attention of everyone nearby. Whispers rippled through the crowd, and phones were raised one after another, recording the unfolding drama.

Avery halted, her gaze flickering from the lilies in Julian’s hands to the glittering necklace Jace held out. Her face remained impassive, as if these tokens were nothing more than meaningless objects. A faint, almost imperceptible glint of mockery danced in her eyes.

As both men edged closer, Avery calmly pulled out her phone and spoke in a clear, unwavering tone. “Hello, International Arrivals Gate A. I’m being harassed by a crowd. Please send security.”

The expressions on Julian and Jace’s faces shifted instantly—surprise, frustration, and something darker.

“Ave!” Julian called out.

“Avery!” Jace echoed.

She didn’t spare either of them a glance. Turning slightly toward the gathering crowd, she added politely but firmly, “Excuse me. Thank you.”

Security arrived swiftly, moving to form a barrier between Avery and the two men.

Escorted by two guards, Avery wheeled her suitcase through the sea of murmurs and curious stares, heading straight for the cab stand before disappearing into the city beyond.

Julian’s jaw tightened in frustration, while Jace’s face contorted with fury. The lilies and diamonds suddenly seemed like props in a cruel, failed performance.

Back in the city, Avery threw herself into her new role at Sterling Holdings. She adapted quickly, making sharp, decisive decisions that earned her the respect and trust of both her manager and her team within weeks.

Yet the Mercer brothers didn’t relent.

Julian, unable to accept Avery’s independence, wielded Mercer Group’s power to pressure Sterling Holdings’ executives. He suggested that if Avery returned to him, Mercer Group would offer significant business advantages and might even consider acquiring shares in Sterling Holdings.

Caught in the crossfire, the executives summoned Avery for a private meeting, subtly hinting that her personal life might jeopardize her career if left unmanaged.

Avery listened calmly, her eyes steady. Then she asked pointedly, “Will the company bow to capital interests, or will it stand by its employees’ rights and uphold the principle of independent operation?”

Returning to her desk, she began organizing her files with quiet determination. Then she told her manager, “If my presence is seen as a problem for the company, I am prepared to resign today. I’m confident I can find another position based on my own merits.”

Her unwavering resolve left the executives momentarily speechless. Ultimately, Julian’s pressure failed to sway them.

For the first time, he realized that neither money nor power could manipulate the woman he once believed he controlled. The loss of that control gnawed at him, fueling a restless edge that only made him more unsettled.
