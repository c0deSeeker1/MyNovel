    Title: Mr Melendez, Your Wife Wants Divorce Long Ago
Premise: The story revolves around a marriage that has long been emotionally fractured. The husband (Mr. Melendez) and his wife are drifting apart — though outwardly married, the wife has silently been preparing for their divorce. The novel explores the emotional fallout of this dissolution: how the wife copes with the fading of the relationship, how the husband reacts (or maybe fails to react), and the internal and external consequences for both.

Key themes:

Long-standing marital disconnect: the marriage has been strained for a long time, hence “long ago”.

Separation of heart before separation of paper: the wife’s decision to move toward divorce comes after much emotional distance.

Self-discovery and transformation: as one partner gives up, the other may wake up, realize what’s been lost or what must change.

The ripple effects on identity, dignity, love, loss and starting over.

Tone & style: The novel appears to be emotional, introspective, dealing with the inner turmoil of its characters rather than just external drama. It’s likely written with a focus on relationship dynamics and the vulnerability of each person involved.
